# ðŸ“„ Applying and studying Prolog
Studies in Prolog involve learning a logical programming language used to model problems declaratively. This includes understanding concepts such as predicate logic, recursion, unification, and the construction of expert systems.

## :link: Description
Studies in Prolog encompass understanding a logical programming language that is fundamentally different from traditional imperative languages. Prolog is centered on predicate logic, where programs are defined by a set of rules and facts that represent relationships between entities. Development in Prolog involves modeling problems in terms of predicates and rule clauses, allowing the expression of complex logic in a concise and elegant way.
